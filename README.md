⚙️ Getting Started

Note: Make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. Run it in one terminal:

# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

Step 2: Start your Application

In a new terminal, run the app on Android or iOS:

For Android
npm run android
# or
yarn android

For iOS
npm run ios
# or
yarn ios


If everything is set up correctly, your app will run in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.
(You can also run it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.)

Step 3: Modifying your App

Open App.tsx and edit some code.

For Android: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or open Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux, <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> on macOS).

For iOS: Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> in the Simulator.
